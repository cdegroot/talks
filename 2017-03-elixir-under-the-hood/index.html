# Elixir Under the Hood

(or: OTP and you)

---
# Agenda

1. Introduction
2. What _are_ Erlang, BEAM, OTP?
3. OTP
4. Mix and releases

---
# Introduction

* Elixir is awesome-sauce on top of Erlang/BEAM/OTP
* Sometimes, though, you need to open up the hood
* Knowing the engine makes you a better developer

---
# Erlang

* The language originally developed by Joe Armstrong for Ericsson AB
* Mash-up of Prolog, Lisp, and other '80s cool things
* Language plus libs ("BIFs").fn[1]
* Immutable, pattern matching, functional

.footnote[.fn[1] https://rvirding.blogspot.ca/2009/10/what-are-bifs.html]

---
# BEAM

* The Erlang virtual machine
* Implements the Built-In-Functions
* Allows to talk to the ouside world (ports and NIFs)
* All the heavy lifting, basically

???

http://www.erlang-factory.com/upload/presentations/708/HitchhikersTouroftheBEAM.pdf

---
# OTP

* A set of conventions around Erlang+BEAM
  * Common patterns
  * How to package stuff
  * How to deploy/start stuff
  * How to upgrade stuff

???
http://learnyousomeerlang.com/what-is-otpt

---
# OTP

You can write what you want without a single reference to OTP!

Use `send` / `receive` etcetera.

..but you shouldn't.

---
# Example: process mailboxes.fn[1]

* Unbounded FIFOs with filtering

```elixir
> send self(), :message_one
> send self(), :message_two
> receive do
>   :message_two -> IO.puts("Got message two")
> end
Got message two
>
```
What happened with message one?

.footnote[.fn[1] How to crash Erlang: http://prog21.dadgum.com/43.html]
???

Luckily, GenServer doesn't have a selective receive loop

---
# Everyday OTP.fn[1]

* GenServer (gen_server)
* Supervisor (supervisor)
* Application (application)

*OTP defines standard behavior*

.footnote[.fn[1] We skip Agent and Task for now]

---
# GenServer

* Mostly defined in `gen_server`, the Erlang module.
* Closest thing to an "object" - behaviour + state.
  * Behaviour: the module.
  * Where's the state?

???
Demo - open up observer. Where's the module, anyway?

---
# GenServer state

On the stack:

```erlang
loop(Parent, Name, State, Mod, Time, Debug) ->
    Msg = receive Input -> Input
          after Time -> timeout
          end,
    decode_msg(Msg, Parent, Name, State, Mod, Time, Debug, false).
```
with `decode_msg` -> `handle_msg` -> `loop(... new state)`

???

...and now you know how gen_server finds the correct code as well...

---
# Supervisor

.normalimg[![A supervisor](supervisor.png)]

---
# Supervisor

.normalimg[![Supervisor state](supervisor_state.png)]

---
# Supervisor

Important things to realize:
* It's just a process
* It takes _specifications_ of children, not children
  * That makes the restart magic possible!

---
# Design considerations

When to use....
* Most well-known principles hold:
  * Single responsibility is key
  * Dependency injection is important

---
# Design considerations

When to use Task
* Async process with "closed" state
* Supervised or not
  * Are we interested in failure?

---
# Design considerations

When to use Agent
* Process with just state
* Behaviour is dynamic, but please KISS

---
# Design considerations

When to use GenServer
* Most of the time
* State and behaviour

---
# Design considerations

When to use Supervisor
* When GenServer wants subprocesses
* Split Supervisor and GenServer
  * More typing, but more SRP

---
# Antipatterns

Globals everywhere - global process name
```elixir
def start_link do
  GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, [], name: __MODULE__)
end
```
Highlander process - there can only be one.

---
# Antipatterns

Globals everywhere - call global processes
```elixir
def my_function do
  MyGenServerThingy.do_some_work()
end
...
def do_some_work do
  GenServer.call(__MODULE__, {:do_some_work})
end
```

---
# Antipatterns

Use DI instead
```elixir
def my_function(state) do
  MyGenServerThingy.do_some_work(state.mgst_pid)
end
...
def do_some_work(pid) do
  GenServer.call(pid, {:do_some_work})
end
```

---
# Antipatterns

`GenServer.call` everywhere
* It's synchronous, introduces waits
* It has a default 5 second timeout
* `cast` and callbacks
  * Basically, that's what a call does anyway :P
  * Think async!

---
# Application

* Deployable item under OTP
* Scope of reuse
* Group of supervised processes

Comparable with pretty much nothing else.

---
# Application
```elixir
def start(type, args) do
  ... what do I do here?
end
```
`type` is always `{:normal}`. If not, you know what
you're doing.fn[1]

.footnote[.fn[1]&nbsp;http://erlang.org/doc/design_principles/distributed_applications.html]

---
# Application
```elixir
def start(type, args) do
  #... what do I do here?
end
```
`args` is almost always the `[]` from `mix.exs`:
```elixir
def application do
  [mod: {MyApp, []}]
end
```
You could pass stuff like a version here, maybe?

---
# Application
```elixir
def start(_type, _args) do
  MyApp.Supervisor.start_link()
end
```
That's your 99%-of-the-cases correct boilerplate
* Return a Supervisor
* `self()` is usually not what you want.
* Keep two files - people expect it and files are cheap.

---
# Application
```elixir
def stop(_state) do
  # Insert teard-down code here
end
```
If you want graceful shutdown, don't forget the `stop`
callback!

---
# Application or Supervisor?
* Application makes for very simple reuse
* A library is always an OTP application,
* .. but doesn't always start a process tree
* If you have a GenServer in your library, you probably want one
* Consider it for each module in an umbrella setup.

---
# Mix and OTP

It is very important to know what happens compile time
and what happens run time!

(Demo)

???

Demo steps:
- Open mix.exs
- Open config files and code.
- Run with various envs
- Release and run

---
# What happened there?

```elixir
  @world Application.get_env(:under_the_hood, :world)
```

A compile-time constant.

```elixir
  def hello_module do
    @world
  end
```

Therefore also a compile-time constant.

---
# What happened there?

```elixir
  def hello_config do
    Application.get_env(:under_the_hood, :world)
  end
```
Normal run-time stuff, so this works as expected:

```elixir
  def start(_, _) do
    Application.put_env(:under_the_hood, :world,
                        "go go go!")
    IO.puts("Hello_config: #{hello_config()}")
  end
```

---
# Under the hood

```elixir
 def decompile(env) do
    beam = "_build/#{env}/lib/under_the_hood/ebin/Elixir.UnderTheHood.beam"
    |> to_charlist
    {:ok,{_,[{:abstract_code,{_,codez}}]}} =
      :beam_lib.chunks(beam, [:abstract_code])
    IO.puts(:erl_prettypr.format(
      :erl_syntax.form_list(codez)))
  end
```

(Demo)
???
    $ iex -S mix
    > UnderTheHood.decompile("dev")

---
# Under the hood

```elixir
$ iex -S mix
...
iex(1)> UnderTheHood.decompile("dev")
...
hello_config() ->
    'Elixir.Application':get_env(under_the_hood, world).

hello_module() -> <<"in dev">>.
...
```

---
# OTP Releases .fn[1]

```bash
$ MIX_ENV=prod mix release
Compiling 1 file (.ex)
==> Assembling release..
==> Building release under_the_hood:0.1.0 using environment prod
==> Including ERTS 8.2 from /Users/cees/.asdf/installs/erlang/19.2/lib/erlang/erts-8.2
==> Packaging release..
==> Release successfully built!
    You can run it in one of the following ways:
      Interactive: _build/prod/rel/under_the_hood/bin/under_the_hood console
      Foreground: _build/prod/rel/under_the_hood/bin/under_the_hood foreground
      Daemon: _build/prod/rel/under_the_hood/bin/under_the_hood start
```

.footnote[.fn[1](here with Distillery)]

---
# OTP Releases

```bash
$ _build/prod/rel/under_the_hood/bin/under_the_hood foreground
Hello_config: go go go!
Hello_module: production, dude!
```
..all good, but:
```bash
$ MIX_ENV=dev _build/prod/rel/under_the_hood/bin/under_the_hood foreground
Hello_config: go go go!
Hello_module: production, dude!
```
What happened to `MIX_ENV`??

---
# OTP Releases

*In a release, there's no Mix*

```erlang
$ cat _build/prod/rel/under_the_hood/releases/0.1.0/sys.config
[{sasl,[{errlog_type,error}]},
 {under_the_hood,[{world,<<"production, dude!">>}]}].
```
is all that's left of
```elixir
config :under_the_hood,
  world: "production, dude!"
```
---
# OTP Releases

*Do not use Mix for run-time configuration*

Alternatives:
* `Application.put_env` - but only if you know that this will be evaluated
before the application that needs it uses it;
* Distillery's dirty `sys.config` env var expansion hack.

---
# REPLACE_OS_VARS

*12FA for Elixir apps!*

```erlang
$ MIX_ENV=test mix release
...
$ cat _build/test/rel/under_the_hood/releases/0.1.0/sys.config
[{sasl,[{errlog_type,error}]},{under_the_hood,[{world,<<"${GREETING}">>}]}].
$ export REPLACE_OS_VARS=true GREETING=peoples
$ _build/test/rel/under_the_hood/bin/under_the_hood foreground
Hello before put: peoples
...
```
Awesome!

---
# REPLACE_OS_VARS

```erlang
$ export GREETING=build_time
$ MIX_ENV=test mix release
...
$ cat _build/test/rel/under_the_hood/releases/0.1.0/sys.config
[{sasl,[{errlog_type,error}]},{under_the_hood,[{world,<<"build_time">>}]}].
$ export REPLACE_OS_VARS=true GREETING=peoples
$ _build/test/rel/under_the_hood/bin/under_the_hood foreground
Hello before put: build_time
```
By now, you should grok this :-)

---
# Summary

* *Never* assign an `Application.get_env/2` to a module attribute
* *Do* use `REPLACE_OS_VARS` but be careful when building
* For your own application, a straight `System.get_env/1` may be preferable.

---
# Sidestep - Docker

* Use a release inside a Docker
* 12FA it with `REPLACE_OS_VARS`
* Shameless plug: `docker_distiller`.fn[1] does it all
  * Combines multiple releases in one container
  * Confusingly now allows MIX_ENV again.fn[2] ;-)

.footnote[.fn[2] yeah, maybe a bug]
