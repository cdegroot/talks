# Elixir Under the Hood

---

# Agenda

1. Introduction
2. What _are_ Erlang, BEAM, OTP?
3. OTP
4. Mix

---

# Introduction

* Elixir is awesome-sauce on top of Erlang/BEAM/OTP
* Sometimes, though, you need to open up the hood
* Knowing the engine makes you a better developer

---

# Erlang

* The language originally developed by Joe Armstrong for Ericsson AB
* Mash-up of Prolog, Lisp, and other '80s cool things
* Language plus libs ("BIFs").fn[1]
* Immutable, pattern matching, functional

.footnote[.fn[1] https://rvirding.blogspot.ca/2009/10/what-are-bifs.html]

---

# BEAM

* The Erlang virtual machine
* Implements the Built-In-Functions
* Allows to talk to the ouside world (ports and NIFs)
* All the heavy lifting, basically

???

---

# OTP

* A set of conventions around Erlang+BEAM
* How to package stuff
* How to deploy/start stuff
* How to upgrade stuff

---

# OTP

You can write what you want without a single reference to OTP!

Use `send` / `receive` etcetera.

---

# Everyday OTP

* Supervisor
* Application
* GenServer
* Agent
* Task

---

# Not so everyday OTP

* Releases
* Release handling

---

# Mix

It is very important to know what happens compile time
and what happens run time!
