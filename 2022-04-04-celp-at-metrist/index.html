# About us

_"The first place developers go in order to discover, avoid, debug, monitor, and remediate issues with their third-party
services."_ &mdash; from our first V2MOM

* Founded 2020 by two former PagerDuty employees
* Seed funding in 2021
* Currently 8 people
---
# About us

* We monitor over 60 services from AWS, Azure, GCP, and independent vendors like Heroku, Github, CircleCI,
PagerDuty, etc.
* Cloud platforms are monitored locally from all North-American instances.


... demo. Hopefully ...

Platform development

* Initial proof-of-concept pure AWS serverless play, C#, lots of lambdas
* Messy, slow.
* Very cheap though :)
* Decided to move to Elixir in April 2021, use "CELP" stack.

Elixir and PostgreSQL

* Fast
* Works
* Flexible

Did I miss anything? ;-)
---
Phoenix LiveView

* Every dev is now full-stack
* Works well with the JS libs we need
* Liveliness by default is awesome
* We're a B2B SaaS so not too worried about too many users
---
Commanded

* CQRS/ES library in Elixir
* Natively uses PostgreSQL for event store
* CQRS/ES works extremely well with LiveView
---
CQRS/ES explained in a handful of slides

* Command and Query Responsibility Segregation with Event Sourcing
* Firmly rooted in Domain Driven Design terminology (Evans 2003)
* Quite popular in the Microsoft/.NET world
---
CQRS/ES explained in a handful of slides

* Like accounting, you never update: you add entries to a ledger (events)
* You roll up these entries into useful data (projections)
* It's all a flow of unidirectional messages, async.
---
Commanded and LiveView

* User edits
* LiveView handler creates a Command and sends it off
* Commanded dehydrates aggregate root and forwards Command
* Aggregate root (optionally) emits Event
* Commanded stores Event
* ... projections happen
* ... event handler sends to PubSub
* LiveView receives update from PubSub and reassigns
* Shown on all connected browsers.
