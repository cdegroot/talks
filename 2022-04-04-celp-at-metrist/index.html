# CELP stack at Metrist

# About us

_"The first place developers go in order to discover, avoid, debug, monitor, and remediate issues with their third-party
services."_ &mdash; from our first V2MOM

* Founded 2020 by two former PagerDuty employees
* Seed funding in 2021
* Currently nine people in four countries, six timezones

---
# About us

* We monitor over 60 services from AWS, Azure, GCP, and independent vendors like Heroku, Github, CircleCI,
PagerDuty, etc.
* Cloud platforms are monitored locally from all North-American regions (20 in total).


... demo. Hopefully ...

# Platform development

* Initial proof-of-concept: pure AWS serverless play, C#, lots of lambdas
* Messy, slow.
* Very cheap though :)
* Decided to move to Elixir in April 2021, use "CELP" stack.

# What is CELP?

* <b>C</b>ommanded
* <b>E</b>lixir
* <b>L</b>iveView
* <b>P</b>ostgreSQL

# Elixir and PostgreSQL

* Fast
* Works
* Flexible

Did I miss anything? ;-)

---
# Phoenix LiveView

* Every dev is now full-stack
  * especially with Tailwind
* Works well with the JS libs we need (Graphing/Charting, Apex for now)
* Liveliness by default is awesome
* We're a B2B SaaS so not too worried about too many users eating all memory
  with LiveView session data

---
# Commanded

* CQRS/ES library in Elixir
* Natively uses PostgreSQL for event store
* CQRS/ES works extremely well with LiveView

---
# CQRS/ES explained in a handful of slides

* Command and Query Responsibility Segregation with Event Sourcing
* Firmly rooted in Domain Driven Design terminology (Evans 2003)
* Quite popular in the Microsoft/.NET world

---
# CQRS/ES explained in a handful of slides

* Like accounting, you never update: you add entries to a ledger (events)
* You roll up these entries into useful data (projections)
* It's all a flow of unidirectional messages, async.

# In Code

Shopping cart example. Command:

```elixir
typedstruct module: AddItemToCart do
  field :id, String.t()
  field :product_id, String.t()
end
```

---
# In Code

Phoenix LiveView event handler:

```elixir
def handle_event("add-item", %{product_id: product_id}, socket) do
  App.dispatch(%AddItemToCart(id: socket.assigns.cart_id, product_id: product_id))
  {:noreply, socket}
end
```

---
# In Code

Aggregate root command handler:

```elixir
def execute(cart, c = %AddItemToCart{}) do
  if has_item(cart, c.product_id) do
    raise "You cannot add the same item more than once"
  else
    %ItemAdded{id: cart.id, product_id: c.product_id}
  end
end
```

---
# In Code

Aggregate root event handler:

```elixir
def apply(cart, %ItemAdded{product_id: product_id}) do
  %{cart | items: [product_id | cart.items]}
end
```
---

# In Code

Project event to RDBMS using Ecto:

```elixir
project(e = %ItemAdded{}, _metadata, fn multi ->
  Ecto.Multi.insert(multi, :project, %Projections.CartItem{
    id: e.id,
    product_id: e.product_id,
  })
end)
```

(`project` is a macro from the Commanded Ecto support library)

---
# In Code

Project event back to UI using Phoenix PubSub:

```elixir
@impl Commanded.Projections.Ecto
def after_update(event, metadata, _changeset) do
  # Application-specific, we assume a helper method to get the
  # topic out of an event
  MyApp.PubSub.broadcast_to_topic_of!(
    event,
    %{event: event, metadata: metadata}
  )
end
```

---
# In Code

Update LiveView state:

```elixir
def handle_info({:event_published,
                %ItemAdded{id: cart_id, product_id: product_id}}, socket) do
  socket = if cart_id == socket.assigns.cart_id do
    assign(socket, items, [product_id | socket.assigns.items])
  else
    socket
  end
  {:noreply, socket}
end
```

---
# Deployment

Commanded supports clustering, we're on AWS, so quite simply:

* Route53 -> AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)
* ALB -> two EC2 instances clustered using `libcluster`
* Managed by Terraform
* Rolling upgrades by simple Elixir script
* All containers for easy distribution
  * but `"--network host"`!
